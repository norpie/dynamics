/// Trait for state types that can auto-dispatch widget events
///
/// This trait enables automatic routing of widget events to Field types,
/// eliminating the need for manual Msg variants and update handlers.
///
/// Usually implemented via `#[derive(AppState)]` with `#[widget("id")]` attributes.

/// The main trait that all TUI apps must implement.
///
/// This follows the Elm architecture:
/// - State: immutable data that represents the app's current state
/// - Msg: events/actions that can happen
/// - update: pure function that handles messages and returns commands
/// - view: pure function that renders the current state
/// - subscriptions: declares what inputs the app wants to receive
///
/// New lifecycle features:
/// - InitParams: typed parameters for app initialization
/// - Lifecycle hooks: on_suspend, on_resume, on_destroy
/// - QuitPolicy: control what happens when navigating away
