CLAUDE.md provides initial context for a stateless engineer (no memory between sessions) starting work on the project. It should give enough architectural overview to know where to look for what, without drowning in implementation details. Think: "what exists, where it lives, what keywords to search for" rather than "how it works" or "full API documentation". Keep it concise - prefer pointing to actual files over explaining their contents.
