1. ✅ **Widget event aggregation** - COMPLETE
   - Created widget event enums (AutocompleteEvent, TextInputEvent, ListEvent, TreeEvent, SelectEvent)
   - Created unified field types (AutocompleteField, TextInputField) that own value + state
   - Added handle_event methods to all widget states
   - Added on_event() builder methods alongside existing on_input/on_select/on_navigate
   - Reduces autocomplete Msg variants from 3 to 1
   - Reduces update handler code by ~80% (Example7: 55 lines → 10 lines)
   - See Example7 for working implementation
