/// Resource type for managing async state in a type-safe, explicit way.

/// of an asynchronous operation:
/// - NotAsked: Initial state, no request made yet
/// - Loading: Request in progress
/// - Success: Request completed successfully with data
/// - Failure: Request failed with error
///
/// This eliminates the need for separate `loading: bool` and `data: Option<T>`
/// fields, making async state management cleaner and less error-prone.
